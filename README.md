# Single Page Website

> I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a single-page website that showcases some of my skills, recommendations, and bio. 
  This website was created as a final lab assignment for the Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript course offered by IBM 
  (which is course 2 of the IBM Full Stack Developer Professional Certification Program).
